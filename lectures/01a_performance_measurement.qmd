claim 1  measurement bias is commonplace and significant

Consider a researcher who wants to determine if
optimization O is beneficial for system S. If she measures
S and S + O in an experimental setup that favors S + O,
she may overstate the effect of O or even conclude that O
is beneficial even when it is not. This phenomenon is called
measurement bias in the natural and social sciences. 

Are O3 optimizations are
beneficial to program performance when the experimental
setups differ. Specifically, we consider experimental setups
that differ along two dimensions: (i) UNIX environment size
(i.e., total number of bytes required to store the environment
variables) because it affects the alignment of stack allocated
data; and (ii) link order (the order of .o files that we give to
the linker) because it affects code and data layout.


tests 
all C benchmarks from spec benchmark 9 int and 3 float 
ran each 5940 times over 12 days  ran on real hardware
used gcc  

test link order 
-8% to +10% speedup based on link order 
same results on simulator 

test environment size 
-10% to +10 percent speedup 

ran some of the tests using intel c compiler to show its not gcc specific.


Claim 2 researchers need to  consider measurement bias

None of the papers in APLOS 2008, PACT 2007, PLDI 2007, and CGO 2007 address measurement bias satisfactorily.

Of the 133 papers published in the surveyed conference proceedings, 88 had at least one section dedicated to experimental methodology and evaluation. 
The median speedup reported by these papers was 10%.
