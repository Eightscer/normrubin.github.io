This course draws heavily from the [CS6120 Advanced Compilers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/) course at Cornell University.
Special thanks to Adrian Sampson for granting permission to use his course materials.


You can find videos of Adrian Sampson's lectures on the CS6120 self-guided [page](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/self-guided/). These videos provide an in-depth explanation of many topics we'll cover in this course.


I want to take a moment to address an important aspect of this course: its evolving nature. Since this is the first time this course is being offered, please be aware that both the schedule and assignments may change as we progress.
