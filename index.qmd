I'm basing a lot of this course on the [cs120 Advanced Compilers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/) at Cornell.  Thanks to Adrian Sampson for permission to use his stuff. You may find his web site helpful.


You can see videos of Adrian's [lectures](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/self-guided/)
