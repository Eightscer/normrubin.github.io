Task2: Implement “trivial” dead code elimination in which you delete instructions that are
never used before they are reassigned. Then implement local value numbering. Try
pairing it with your dead code elimination code, in the write up be sure to include
evidence that your implementation is correct and actually optimizes programs, you
might want to use the Brench program, for extra points, extend your implementation to
handle some of the tricker examples talked about in class.
